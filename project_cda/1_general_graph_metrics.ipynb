    "In this section, we analyze the evolution of the User social graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Note:**\n",
    "Unlike the Anime graph, the User graph is significantly larger and denser. To ensure calculations complete in a reasonable time, we have **disabled path-based metrics** (Betweenness Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Diameter, Radius, and Average Path Length). These metrics require traversing every possible path between nodes, which is computationally infeasible for large social networks in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Active Metrics for Users:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Scale**\n",
    "* **Active Users (Nodes):** Total count of unique users participating in the network.\n",
    "* **Interactions (Edges):** Total number of connections (friendships or shared interactions) between users.\n",
    "* **Density:** The ratio of actual social connections to potential ones (network saturation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Social Structure & Fragmentation**\n",
    "* **Connected Components:** The number of isolated user groups.\n",
    "* **LCC Size:** The size of the Largest Connected Component (the main \"giant\" community).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Social Cohesion (Clustering)**\n",
    "* **Global Transitivity:** The probability that two of a user's friends are also friends with each other (global triangle ratio).\n",
    "* **Avg Clustering Coefficient:** The average local \"clique-ness\" of user circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchy & Homophily**\n",
    "* **Avg Degree & Std:** The average number of friends per user and the inequality of popularity.\n",
    "* **Core Number (Mean & Max):** A measure of how deep users are embedded in the social web (identifying the \"inner circle\").\n",
    "* **Assortativity:** The correlation between linked users (do popular users tend to connect with other popular users?)."
