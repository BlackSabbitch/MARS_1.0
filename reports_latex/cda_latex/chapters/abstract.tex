This study analyzes the structural evolution of the MyAnimeList platform (2006–2018). Utilizing time-sliced networks,
we examine the dynamics of taste communities and user navigation. We employ the Leiden algorithm to trace the genealogy
of clusters from a cohesive core to a fragmented landscape. Regarding user modeling, we find that stochastic random walker
agents diverge from empirical trajectories, indicating the limitations of purely topological simulation. In contrast, machine
learning experiments successfully predict user migration patterns. Crucially, we demonstrate that the inclusion of community-based
clustering metrics significantly improves model accuracy, highlighting the predictive value of mesoscale network features.
